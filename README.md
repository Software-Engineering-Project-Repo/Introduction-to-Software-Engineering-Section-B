The code defines a Boat class with methods for boat hiring and calculates the daily summary of boat usage. It creates a list of 10 boats, allowing users to hire boats for specific durations. The program tracks the money earned, total hours hired, and identifies the most used boat. The main function interacts with the user for boat hiring, displays currently available boats, and generates a daily summary of boat usage and earnings at the end of the day. The system uses fixed initial availability and restricts return times to be before or at 5:00 PM.
